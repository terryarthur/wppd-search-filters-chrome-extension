# WordPress Plugin Filter Extension - Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 2025  
**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

The WordPress Plugin Filter Extension ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Chrome browser extension.

## Information We Collect

### Data We DO NOT Collect

The Extension operates with a **privacy-first approach** and does NOT collect, store, or transmit any of the following:

- ❌ Personal information (names, emails, addresses)
- ❌ Browsing history outside of WordPress.org
- ❌ User credentials or login information  
- ❌ Search queries or filter preferences
- ❌ Analytics or tracking data
- ❌ Cookies or persistent identifiers
- ❌ Device fingerprinting information

### Data We Access (Locally Only)

The Extension accesses the following data **locally in your browser only**:

- ✅ **WordPress.org plugin directory pages** - To inject filter controls
- ✅ **Current page URL parameters** - To detect search terms on WordPress.org
- ✅ **WordPress.org Plugins API responses** - To fetch and filter plugin data

### Third-Party API Usage

The Extension makes requests to the **WordPress.org Plugins API** (https://api.wordpress.org/plugins/) to:

- Fetch plugin metadata (ratings, installation counts, update dates)
- Retrieve plugin descriptions and author information
- Access plugin health metrics from public WordPress.org support pages

**Important:** These API calls are made directly from your browser to WordPress.org. We do not intermediate, log, or store any API responses.

## How We Use Information

All data processing occurs **locally in your browser**:

- **Filtering:** Plugin data is filtered client-side based on your criteria
- **Caching:** API responses are temporarily cached (5 minutes) in browser memory only
- **Display:** Enhanced plugin cards are generated locally from API data

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage Only
- All data remains **exclusively in your browser**
- **No data is transmitted** to our servers (we don't have any servers)
- **Temporary caching** clears automatically after 5 minutes
- **No persistent storage** of personal information

### Security Measures
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** prevents unauthorized script execution
- **Minimal permissions** - Only accesses WordPress.org domains
- **No inline scripts** - All code follows security best practices
- **HTTPS-only** API communications

## Your Privacy Rights

Since we don't collect personal data, you automatically have:

- ✅ **Complete data control** - All processing is local
- ✅ **No tracking** - Your browsing habits are private
- ✅ **Easy removal** - Uninstall the extension to remove all traces
- ✅ **No accounts required** - Extension works without registration

## WordPress.org Integration

The Extension integrates with WordPress.org's public services:

- **WordPress.org Plugins API** - Public plugin directory data
- **WordPress.org support pages** - Public support forum metrics

Please refer to [WordPress.org's Privacy Policy](https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/) for information about their data practices.

## Extension Permissions

The Extension requests minimal Chrome permissions:

- **`activeTab`** - Access current WordPress.org plugin pages only
- **`host_permissions`** - Limited to `wordpress.org` and `api.wordpress.org`

These permissions are used exclusively for the stated functionality and never for data collection.

## Children's Privacy

The Extension does not knowingly collect information from users under 13 years of age. Since we don't collect any personal information, the Extension is safe for all users.

## International Users

The Extension processes all data locally in your browser, regardless of your location. No data crosses international borders through our systems.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in the Extension's functionality. Updates will be posted with a new "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the Extension constitutes acceptance of any changes.

## Data Portability and Deletion

Since no personal data is collected or stored:

- **No data to export** - All processing is local
- **No data to delete** - Nothing is stored on our end
- **Complete removal** - Uninstalling removes all Extension traces
